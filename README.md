# Formula One Quiz

## Description

This project was designed to test the user's F1 knowledge with a short 5-question quiz. F1 is a passion of mine, so making an F1 themed quiz was the first thing that came to mind. Ideally, the user will test their knowledge and learn something new.

Throughout creating this quiz, I learned a ton about JavaScript. I learned about making arrays within objects and how to access that information, how to display/hide page information, how to index questions by writing effective functions and referencing their related variables, how to create a timer and manipulate its properties, how to hide/display questions based on index, how to match answers with a user's click, and how to save the user's responses into local storage.

This homework has definitely been the most difficult but beneficial assignment for me so far, as it tested my limits and taught me a vast amount about JavaScript.
